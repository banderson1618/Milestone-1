# Milestone-1
The website designs and details are found in Files > Static HTML (the WebsiteSpecifications.pdf page has some styling specifications):

The idea behind this is as a web developer you won't be asked to design just program what the designer has created.

Also if you would like to create the first 3 pages of your portfolio site which has at least a homepage, about, and contact page then you can do that and it will be graded with similar expectations as the static site created here.

Assignment
1) Create a new GitHub repository

2) If the repo is private then make sure to add kamijean as a collaborator so I can examine the code, if it is public then you won't need to add me as collaborator.

3) Create a .gitignore file in the main section of the project

4) Ignore all the .orig files (and if you have a mac ignore the .DS_Store files) and any other files you feel necessary to ignore

5) Create an index.html page which will be your homepage, an about.html, and a contact.html pages

6) Put images into an image folder8

7) Make sure all pages have associated titles to describe what they are

8) Add basic bootstrap.css file or whatever you've chose to make your project responsive to the project.

9) Use the images and help to create HTML and CSS to the 3 pages given to you in the Files

10) Use javascript to validate the contact form before submission (e.i. verify the email is a valid email or is present as well as the name) and show error/success message if it validates.

11) Use javascript or css to animate at least one element on the site

12) Put site online via Cloud9 or Heroku or on a domain you own

13) Submit both your code to GitHub and link to live site
